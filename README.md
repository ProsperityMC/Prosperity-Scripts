A collection of [Scarpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/docs/scarpet/Documentation.md) scripts performing various functions on the Prosperity server.

## Current scripts

### Customize `v2.0.0`

A command which allows the player to modify the `CustomModelData` property of their items. Requires a resource pack to function. There are plans to expand this with features like colors and lore, as well as an option to require a certain experience level to run the command.
